    <h1>About MoDoVation</h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
        MoDoVation is a productivity app.
        <br>
        It allows you to set major goals, and provide a way to achieve these in a quantifiable way.
        <br><br>
        We encourage you to continue pursuing your goals everyday by counting the number of days you've worked towards it.
        <br><br>
        Reflect on your progress through journal entries, allowing you to meditate on what's working well, and what can be improved.
        <br><br>
        Plan your days, to make time for you to pursue your goals. 
        <br>
        A to do list featuring what you need to do in your personal life, at work, 
        and other chores allows you to see where you'll have to allocate your time throughout the day.
        
        <br><br>

        We wanted to make a project that we would find useful ourselves, and that others could also find useful.
