    <h4>Why?</h4>
    <p>
        This web application was completed as the Capstone project for Durham College's Computer Programmer Analyst program.
        <br><br>
        It was created by Keith Mathur & Liam Stachiw.

    <h4>Why a Laravel web application?</h4>
    <p>
        Both of us have been strongly interested in our web development courses at Durham College. <br>
        We have had the idea for this productivity app for a while now, and we decided that a web application 
        would be the best platform for this project. <br>
        We also want to leave the option to expand on the site, and publish it in the future. 
        <br>
        The intent is for people to sign up, and make the site your home page. 
        <br>
        While a mobile app could have worked well for this project, we wanted to expand on skillsets learned in Durham College rather 
        learn a new technology to develop it.
        <br>
        Both of us enjoyed working with the Laravel framework in WEBD 5201. We also found it was a popular framework with a great deal of resources that would help us in development.
