# About MoDoVation

MoDoVation is a productivity app.

It allows you to set major goals, and provide a way to achieve these in a quantifiable way.

We encourage you to continue pursuing your goals everyday by counting the number of days you've worked towards it.

Reflect on your progress through journal entries, allowing you to meditate on what's working well, and what can be improved.

Plan your days, to make time for you to pursue your goals. 

A to do list featuring what you need to do in your personal life, at work, 
and other chores allows you to see where you'll have to allocate your time throughout the day.


We wanted to make a project that we would find useful ourselves, and that others could also find useful.

# Purpose

#### Why?

This web application was completed as the Capstone project for Durham College's Computer Programmer Analyst program.

#### Why a Laravel web application?

Both of us have been strongly interested in our web development courses at Durham College. 

We have had the idea for this productivity app for a while now, and we decided that a web application 
would be the best platform for this project. 

We also want to leave the option to expand on the site, and publish it in the future. 

The intent is for people to sign up, and make the site your home page. 

While a mobile app could have worked well for this project, we wanted to expand on skillsets learned in Durham College rather 
learn a new technology to develop it.

Both of us enjoyed working with the Laravel framework in WEBD 5201. We also found it was a popular framework with a great deal of resources that would help us in development.
